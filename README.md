CPU Scheduling Simulator

A modern and interactive CPU Scheduling Simulator built using Python (Tkinter + Matplotlib).
It helps visualize how different CPU scheduling algorithms work by generating Gantt Charts, process statistics, and average performance metrics in real time.

🚀 Features
Add, edit, delete, and randomize processes
Supports major scheduling algorithms:
FCFS
SJF (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)
LJF (Non-Preemptive)
Priority (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)
LRTF (Preemptive)
Round Robin
Computes CT, TAT, WT, RT + averages\
Interactive Gantt Chart visualization
CPU execution playback animation
Theme toggle (Light/Dark)
Save chart as PNG


🖥️ Technologies Used
